# BroadcastCommander

A lightweight Android library for handling broadcast commands with ease through XML configuration.

---

## Features

- Simple XML-based command mapping configuration
- Support for different command types (Bundle, String(TODO), Boolean(TODO), Int(TODO))
- Reflection-based command execution
- Callback support for command handling
- Clean architecture implementation
- TODO: Thread-safe callback management

---

## Installation

Add the dependency to your app's `build.gradle`:

```gradle
dependencies {
    implementation 'io.github.airdaydreamers:broadcastcommander:x.x.x'
}
```

---

## Setup

1. Create an XML file in your `res/xml` directory to define command mappings. You can choose between two XML formats:

### Simple Format (`command_mappings_simple.xml`):
```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<commands>
    <command
        action="SIMPLE_ACTION_COMMAND_BUNDLE"
        handler="com.example.app.handlers.SimpleCommandUseCase"
        type="android.os.Bundle" />
</commands>
```

### Detailed Format (`command_mappings.xml`):
```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<commandItems xmlns:lib="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res-auto">
    <item
        lib:className="com.example.app.handlers.CommandUseCase"
        lib:command="ACTION_COMMAND_BUNDLE"
        lib:type="Bundle" />
</commandItems>
```

2. Create handler classes for your commands:

```kotlin
class SimpleCommandUseCase {
    operator fun invoke(bundle: Bundle) {
        // Handle the command
        bundle.getString("text")?.let {
            // Process the text
        }
    }
}
```

## Usage

### Sending Commands

You can send commands using ADB or programmatically:

#### Using ADB:
```bash
adb shell am broadcast -a io.github.airdaydreamers.commands.ACTION_COMMAND --es command "SIMPLE_ACTION_COMMAND_BUNDLE" --es text "Hello World" your.package.name
```

#### Programmatically:
```kotlin
val intent = Intent("io.github.airdaydreamers.commands.ACTION_COMMAND").apply {
    putExtra("command", "SIMPLE_ACTION_COMMAND_BUNDLE")
    putExtra("text", "Hello World")
}
context.sendBroadcast(intent)
```

### Handling Commands

The library automatically handles commands based on your XML configuration. When a command is received:

1. The library looks up the command in your XML configuration
2. Instantiates the corresponding handler class
3. Invokes the handler with the provided bundle

### Command Types

The library supports several command types:
- `Bundle`: For complex data structures
- `String`: For text-based commands -> TODO
- `Boolean`: For toggle-like commands -> TODO
- `Int`: For numeric commands -> TODO
- `Callback`: For commands requiring callbacks -> TODO

## Command Handler Implementation

Your command handlers should follow this pattern:

```kotlin
class YourCommandHandler {
    operator fun invoke(bundle: Bundle? = null) {
        // Handle the command
    }
    
    // Optional: Handle with context
    operator fun invoke(context: Context, bundle: Bundle? = null) {
        // Handle the command with context
    }
}
```

---

## Callback Support

Register callbacks to receive command notifications:

```kotlin
CallbackManager.registerCallback { bundle ->
    // Handle command callback
}
```

Don't forget to unregister when done:

```kotlin
CallbackManager.unregisterCallback(callback)
```
